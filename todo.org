#+TODO: TODO IN-PROGRESS REVIEW DONE
* Response Processing
** TODO Return proper values for ints, true, and false
* API
** TODO Create a macro that allows for command creation
*** See redis-clojure as an example https://github.com/ragnard/redis-clojure/blob/master/src/redis.clj#L75
** TODO Create a representation of every command offered in redis
* Tests
** TODO Create a regression suite out of the currently commented code
*** This is just a representation of the tutorial offered on the redis site
** TODO Create a small test for each of the redis commands to demonstrate that they work as expected
*** This might be difficult for things like TTL
